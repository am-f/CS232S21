1.What instructions evaluate “a>6”?
	cmpl $6,-4(%ebp) 

2.What happens if we delete the “jmp” instruction?
	If we delete the "jmp" instructio then we would go into the else statement (c -= 2) after the if statement, regardless of the value of a.

3.Can you rewrite the condition with “jg” in place of “jle” without changing semantic of the program? Why or why not?
	I'm not totally certain what the "semantic of the program" means but, to use jg instead of jle, you need to switch the order of the condition.  You do
	if(a <= 6) {
		c -= 2;
	} else {
		c += 2;
	}
