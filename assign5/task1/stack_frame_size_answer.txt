I think the stack frame size of printSumRangeRecursive is 64 bytes because, when first hit the breakpoint at line 22 and then type p &start, I get:
&start = 0x7ffc6837aa3c
Then, when I type c to continue and type p &start for the next stack frame, I get:
&start = 0x7ffc6837a9fc

The difference between these addresses is 64 bytes.
