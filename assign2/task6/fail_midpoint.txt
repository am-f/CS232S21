midpoint_original
  This function will overflow and return an incorrect answer if the sum of the inputs is not within the integer range for a 32-bit two's complement system, which is [-2147483648, 2147483647].  This can only occur when the inputs are of the same sign (both positive or both negative).
  Examples:
    input x: 2147483647
    input y: 1
    expected midpoint: 1073741824
    midpoint_original: -1073741824

    input x: -2147483648
    input y: -1
    expected midpoint: -1073741825
    midpoint_original: 1073741823

    input x: -1073741823

midpoint_A
  If your second input (y) is the minimum integer (-2147483648), having any positive integer as the first input (x) will cause an overflow, because of "y-x" in the equation for the midpoint.  The minimum integer minus any positive integer will lead to overflow.
  Examples:
    input x: 2147483647
    input y: -2147483648
    expected midpoint: -1
    midpoint_A = 2147483647

    input x: 1
    input y: -2147483648
    expected midpoint: -1073741824 
    midpoint_A: 1073741824 


  Also, having the minimum integer as the first input (x) and a non-negative integer as the second input (y) will result in an incorrect answer, also because of "y-x".  This is because the computer does that subtraction as "y+(-x)", so it converts x to the opposite sign.  In 32-bit two's complement, the positive complement of the minimum integer (-2147483648) not within the range, so trying to change to its complement results in the same binary number, which is still negative.  Therefore "y+(-x)" will be negative, and that number divided by 2 will be negative. Since x is the minimum integer, x plus another negative integer will overflow, leading to the wrong answer.
  Examples:
    input x: -2147483648
    input y: 2147483647
    expected midpoint: -1
    midpoint_A: -2147483648
    
    input x: -2147483648
    input y: 1
    expected midpoint: -1073741824
    midpoint_A: 1073741825

    input x: -2147483648
    input y: 0
    expected midpoint: -1073741824
    midpoint_A: 1073741824


  Expanding from that, if the sum of y and the complement of x is outside of the 32-bit integer range [-2147483648, 2147483647], then midpoint_A will return an incorrect answer.  This would only happen if the inputs have opposite signs (one negative, one positive).
  Examples:
    input x: 2147483647
    input y: -2147483647
    expected midpoint: 0
    midpoint_A: -2147483648

    input x: -2147483647
